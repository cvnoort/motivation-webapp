## Usage

### Requirements

Requires Node.js (version 16+) to run locally,
as well as a suitable browser.

### Installation

To run the web app locally, clone this repository
(inside a directory of your choice, for example `~/github/`)
and install the app as follows:

```
cd ~/github/
git clone https://github.com/cvnoort/motivation-webapp.git
cd motivation-webapp
npm install
```

### Development server

Then start a development server:

```
npm run dev
```

View the application by opening the resulting address in your browser,
for example: `http://localhost:5173/`.
